# AI-Agents

## An AI Agent is a system that uses an LLM to decide the control flow of an application.

**LLM**: In AI, LLM refers to large language models designed for natural language processing that are pre-trained on vast amounts of data. Some of the common LLms are GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, PaLM-2, etc.

### What is an AI Agent?
An AI agent is a software program designed to interact with its environment, perceive the data it receives, and take actions based on that data to achieve specific goals. 

**Planning:** An AI agent sets goals and creates milestone-based plans to achieve the goals.

**Memory:** They use memory to process immediate prompts and remember past interactions, often through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

**Tools:** AI agents interact with external APIs to retrieve data or execute commands, enabling them to perform multi-step tasks and adapt to dynamic environments.

**Prompt Template:** Provide a set of instructions to instruct the agent.

An AI agent is an autonomous system designed to perceive its environment, process information, and take actions to achieve specific goals or objectives.
